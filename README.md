## Project Structure

````` Calculator
├── src/
│ └── Main.java # Main program file with all features
├── .idea/ # IntelliJ project settings
├── .gitignore # Files ignored by Git
├── Calculator.iml # IntelliJ module file
└── README.md # Project documentation
````` 

## How It Works
1. Run the program (`Main.java`) in IntelliJ IDEA.  
2. Main menu displays:
   - Math Operations ➕➖✖️➗  
   - Games & Fun 🎮  
   - Conversions & Health 🧪  
   - View History 📜  
   - Exit ❌  
3. Select a category → follow prompts for input values.  
4. Results are displayed instantly in the console.  
5. All operations, conversions, and games are recorded in **history**.

## Usage Examples
1.Math Operations Example:

  ```
 Select operation: Addition
Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 7
Result: 12
```
2.Statistics Example:
```
Select statistics operation: Mean
Enter number of elements: 5
Enter elements: 2, 4, 4, 4, 5
Mean = 3.8
```
3.Games Example:
```
🎮 Guess the Number Game
Guess a number between 1 and 100
Enter guess: 50
🔼 Higher!
Enter guess: 75
✅ Correct! The number was 75
```
4.Conversions Example:
```
Enter value in km: 5
5 km = 5000 m
5 km = 3.106855 miles
5 km = 5468.05 yards
```
## Future Improvements

1.Add GUI using JavaFX or Swing

2.Add more advanced math functions (logarithms, trigonometry)

3.Allow saving history to a file

4.More currencies and real-time exchange rates

5.Multi-language support
